    <h2>
      Welcome to Let's Travel the World!
      </h2>
        <p>By traveling - both in the USA and abroad - we expand our horizons and gain a greater appreciation of the world we live in.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>Experiencing other cultures, including new foods, languages, and customs, challenges us and makes us better understand our own culture.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>We are a full service travel agency.  As seasoned travelers ourselves, we know what we're talking about and can draw upon our own experiences
          when putting together a great adventure for you and your family.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>Once you've enjoyed a couple of great trips, you just might "catch the bug" like we did and start planning two or three trips
          ahead!  Maybe you'll even put a big world map up on your wall at home and get the color pushpins...</p>
        
        <br>
      
        <p>So contact us today and let's start planning your next amazing trip!</p>
